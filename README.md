- 👋 Hi, I’m @marisolkoss
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things... I am a seeker of knowledge and find myself constantly falling into the rabbit whole of information. I'm also a musician by trade and love to game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment. I am taking classes to eventually collaborate with others.
